# Costs

There are two types of "cost" stored; dynamic and static.

Static assets consist of a narrow background, "currency x" indicator, and a number. These exist up to a value of 10, after which we need to dynamically generate costs

Dynamic costs store each individual component required to build a larger cost, ie backgrounds and individual numbers for each cost.
