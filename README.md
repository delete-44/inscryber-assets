# Inscryber Assets

Assets for building custom Inscryption cards. These are all scaled to fit a card of size 691x1050px, ~5.5x larger than assets from the base game.

Images are scaled up using "nearest neighbour" resizing, which is suitable for pixel art. For Krita, an open-source image editor, this option exists under `Image > Scale to new size > Set filter to "Nearest Neighbour`

## Unfamiliar with GitHub?

If you're new to GitHub you can still download these resources :) Towards the top-right of the [Inscryber Assets repo](https://github.com/delete-44/inscryber-assets) you should see a green "Code" button. Click this and you'll have an option to "Download ZIP", which can be used as normal.
